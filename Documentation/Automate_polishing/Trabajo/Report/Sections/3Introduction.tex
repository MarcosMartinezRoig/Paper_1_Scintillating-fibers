In this report I will explain the work which we did from 9th april to 13th april when I travelled to Aveiro. This work was carried out within the framework of Tritium project. For explaining this work I will divide it in three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} First of all I will explain the prototype which was designed and built by Aveiro people. 
\item{} Second I will explain the automatize polishing device which we developed. This machine emerges as a necessity when we tried to prepare the fibers which we used in this prototype. 
\item{} Finally I will show the conclusion which we have obtained and what we pretend to do as next step.
\end{itemize}
When we finish the building of this prototype and the checking task, we will put this prototype in Almaraz nuclear power plant together with the Valencia prototype so that we can start to learn about both prototypes and the possible problems which we will have in this place.
